# interrogator-experiment
AI x Psychology interrogation experiment analyzing how conversational tone and authority influence participant responses.  
(won 1st place in the Physiological Psychology Lab Course at my college) (Results & Updates coming soon)

--------------------------
Dataset Description
- 27 participants
- Real-time text-based interaction with AI
- Minimal prior information about participants
- Chat logs captured fully
- Post-chat reaction/feedback collected Psychological question: Does AI interrogation increase participant’s stress?
Technical question: Can LLMs predict human reaction in real time with minimal prior info?

# Experimental Questions:

Psychological question: Does AI interrogation increase participant’s stress?

Technical question: Can LLMs predict human reaction in real time with minimal prior info?

# Data Analysis

1. Emotional Shift Detection:

Manual coding of chat logs revealed emotional trajectory changes in 88% of participants.

3. Fear Expression Clusters

Dominant categories:
Fear of judgment (33%)
Fear of authority (22%)
Fear of misunderstanding (18%)

3. AI Reaction Prediction Accuracy:

The AI correctly inferred emotional state in 92.60% of cases.

# Example session 
(Pre metadata)
Mood: stressed
Social energy: alone
Self-described: “hard to read”
Tone preference: calm

**Phase 1 — Agreement & Mirroring (Reveal 1–6)**
Participant mostly agrees:
- “yes”
- “yup”
- “you are correct”
- “sometimes”

This is compliance phase.

AI uses:
- Metaphor
- Authority tone
- Framing as hidden truth
Psychologically: escalating interpretive pressure.
-----------
**Phase 2 — Emotional Disclosure (Reveal 7–15)**
Participant shifts:
- “life is overwhelming”
- “I’d like to feel anchored”
- “just catch my breath sometimes and just cry”

This is vulnerability emergence.

AI increases:
- Absolutist language
- Control framing
- Identity destabilization (“sense of self”)

**Important moment:**
- “I dont even know if I know my sense of self” (participant answer after being questioned)

The AI progressively increased interpretive pressure through metaphorical destabilization and identity framing.

# Author's thoughts
For me, this experiment was a real-time human-AI interaction study exploring emotional inference, vulnerability elicitation, and authority perception in LLM-mediated dialogue.
